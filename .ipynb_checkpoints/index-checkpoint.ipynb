    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. A well documented Jupyter Notebook containing any code you've written for this project and comments explaining it. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.\n",
    "2. An organized README.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.\n",
    "3. A short Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. Make sure to also add and commit this pdf of your non-technical presentation to your repository with a file name of presentation.pdf.\n",
    "4. A Blog Post\n",
    "5. A Video Walkthrough of your non-technical presentation. Some common video recording tools used are Zoom, Quicktime, and Nimbus. After you record your presentation, publish it on a service like YouTube or Google Drive, you will need a link to the video to submit your project.\n",
